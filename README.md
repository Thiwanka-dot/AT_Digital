A responsive and modern single-page website built using React and Vite, designed for the AT Digital Internship Assessment.
This project showcases a clean UI layout, smooth navigation, and reusable component-based design following current web development best practices.

### Live Demo

ðŸ”— https://at-digital-thiwanka.netlify.app/

### Technologies Used

- React â€“ Component-based JavaScript library for building interactive UIs.

- Vite â€“ Lightweight and fast build tool optimized for React development.

- React Router DOM â€“ Enables smooth client-side navigation without page reloads.

- React Bootstrap â€“ Used for responsive layout and component styling.

> [!Note]
> React Bootstrap was chosen as it is built on top of Bootstrap 5 CSS and provides native React components with the same Bootstrap styling.
This approach allowed better control over custom accordion icons (+ / âˆ’) while fully adhering to the Bootstrap framework requirement.

- CSS Modules â€“ Used for locally scoped and maintainable component-specific styling.

### Key Features

- Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

- Smooth navigation using React Router DOM.

- Clean, modern UI with React Bootstrap and CSS Modules.

- Custom accordion icons with dynamic expand/collapse behavior.

- Fast build and hot reload powered by Vite.
